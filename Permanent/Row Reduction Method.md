## Theory
Row Reduction Method of solving [[System of Linear Equations]] is an advanced and iterative method of solving the equations.

It is based on the row equivalence property of matrices.

It uses [[Augmented Matrix]] to determine the solution.

You change the matrix till it is in one of these forms:
Echelon Forms

1. Row Echelon Form(REF)
2. Reduced REF

## Examples
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
 1&2&3 \\
0&1&4 \\
0&0&1
\end{bmatrix}
