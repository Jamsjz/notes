### Expanded Visualization Aesthetics

1. **Maximize Signal-to-Noise Ratio**  
   - Emphasize the most critical data or trends while minimizing visual distractions.  
   - Remove unnecessary gridlines, excessive colors, or redundant elements.

2. **Use Appropriate Chart Types**  
   - Match the chart type to the data and message:  
     - Use bar charts for comparisons.  
     - Line charts for trends.  
     - Pie charts only for proportions (and sparingly).  
     - Scatterplots for relationships between variables.

3. **Consistency in Design**  
   - Use consistent scales, colors, fonts, and symbol meanings across charts to avoid confusion.  
   - Ensure alignment of axes when comparing similar charts.

4. **Leverage Pre-Attentive Attributes**  
   - Use visual attributes (like color, size, position, shape) to guide the viewer's attention to critical data points.  
   - Highlight significant changes or patterns without overwhelming the viewer.

5. **Design for Accessibility**  
   - Use colorblind-friendly palettes.  
   - Avoid over-reliance on color alone to encode data (e.g., use patterns or labels alongside colors).  
   - Ensure readability with appropriate font sizes and contrast.

6. **Facilitate Comparisons**  
   - Use aligned scales and consistent units to make comparisons intuitive.  
   - Avoid visual distortions like truncated axes or exaggerated proportions.

7. **Focus on Data Integrity**  
   - Represent data truthfully without manipulation or misleading visual effects.  
   - Clearly state data sources and assumptions.  
   - Show uncertainty or variability (e.g., confidence intervals, error bars) when relevant.

8. **Simplify Without Oversimplifying**  
   - Present data in a way that avoids overwhelming the viewer but retains critical details.  
   - Avoid excessive aggregation that obscures meaningful patterns.

9. **Support Interaction (for Digital Visualizations)**  
   - Allow users to drill down into data, filter categories, or hover over points for more information.  
   - Ensure interactivity enhances, rather than complicates, the data story.

10. **Focus on Storytelling**  
    - Frame the visualization to tell a clear and compelling story.  
    - Use annotations, titles, and subtitles to provide context and guide the viewer's interpretation.

11. **Respect Viewer’s Cognitive Load**  
    - Avoid overloading charts with too many data series or complex interactions.  
    - Use small multiples (repeated small charts) to break down complex information into digestible pieces.

12. **Consider Cultural Context**  
    - Be aware of cultural conventions in interpreting visual elements (e.g., red may signify danger in some contexts and celebration in others).
