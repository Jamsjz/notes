## Vertical Line Check

> [!info] Theory
> To check if a curve is a function or not, you do a <u>vertical check</u>.

> [!question] If a vertical line can intersect the graph at two points then it's
> not a function. Why?
> Because if so, one input will give two output and That is not the defination of
> [[Function]]

> [!example] $y=\sin x$ is a function
> ```desmos-graph
> \sin x
> x=4
> ```

> [!example] $x^2+y^2=1$ is not a function
> ```desmos-graph
> x^2+y^2=16
> x=3
> ```

## Horizontal Line Check
> [!info] Theory
> To find if a function is one to one or not, use horizontal line check.
>> [!question] Why?
>> Because in graph, for different x, the y is same.

> [!example] $y=x^2$ is a function but not one to one.
> ```desmos-graph
> y=x^2
> x=1
> ```
