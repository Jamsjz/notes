# Asymptote
==2024-11-22

## Theory
If there exists a line such that the given function $f(x)$ tends to touch that line but never touches it, that line is called the asymptote of $f(x)$.

There are three types of asymptote:
1. [[Vertical Asymptote]]
2. [[Horizontal Asymptote]]
3. [[Oblique Asymptote]]



---
## Examples
Here,
y=0 is [[Horizontal Asymptote]]
x=0 is [[Vertical Asymptote]]

```desmos-graph
y=1/x
y=0
x=0
```
