## Theory
An eigenvector $\bar{v} \in \mathbb{C}^m$ of a square [[Matrices|matrix]] $A$ of order $m\times m$ is a scalar which satisfies the equation:
$$
A \bar{v} = \lambda \bar{v}
$$
where,
- $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix
- $\bar{v}\not=0$ is the corresponding [[Eigenvectors|eigenvector]]
- $\lambda$ is a scalar [[Eigenvalue]].

Eigenvectors are the solutions to the characterstics equation $(A-\lambda I)\bar{v} = 0$.
where, $\bar{v}$ is the eigenvector for the corresponding [[Eigenvalue]].
