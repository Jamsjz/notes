## Theory
Indeterminate forms arise in calculus when evaluating limits that do not lead to a definitive value. The following are the common indeterminate forms:

1. $\frac{0}{0}$
2. $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$
3. $0 \cdot \infty$
4. $1^{\infty}$
5. $0^0$
6. $\infty^0$
7. $\infty - \infty$

These forms require special techniques, such as [[L'Hopital's Rule]] or algebraic manipulation, to evaluate limits effectively.
