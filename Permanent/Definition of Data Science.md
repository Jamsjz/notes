## Definitions of Data Science

- **Wikipedia** describes data science as "a concept to unify statistics, [[Data Analysis]], informatics, and their related methods" to understand and analyze actual phenomena using data. It is an interdisciplinary field that employs techniques from mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to work with structured and unstructured data, aiming to extract knowledge and insights.

- **CodeOp** defines data science as an interdisciplinary field that integrates statistics, mathematics, and computer science to derive actionable insights from large volumes of data. The process involves collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to uncover patterns that inform decision-making and drive innovation.

- **Michigan Technological University** states that data science focuses on extracting relevant insights and developing strategies from data for business and industry. It combines tools and methods from various fields such as mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large datasets.

- **TechTarget** emphasizes that data science applies advanced analytics techniques and scientific principles to extract valuable information from data. It heavily relies on machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and insights within datasets.

- **IBM** highlights that data science merges math, statistics, programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with domain expertise to uncover actionable insights in an organizationâ€™s data. This integration supports decision-making and strategic planning across various industries.

- **Simplilearn** notes that the field of data science involves managing vast amounts of data using modern tools and techniques. It includes steps such as problem definition, data collection, processing raw data for analysis, and interpreting results to find opportunities.

These definitions illustrate that data science is not only about analyzing existing data but also involves a comprehensive process of understanding problems, collecting relevant information, applying analytical techniques, and deriving actionable insights for decision-making across various domains.
