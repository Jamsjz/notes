## Theory
In simple terms, if a vector if dependent on others, it is $LD$.

Given a [[Set]] of [[Vector|Vectors]] $A$, $A$ is said to be Linearly Dependent if $\exists\text{ }\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3},\dots,\alpha_{n_{o}(A)}$ such that the equation:
$\alpha_{1}a_{1}+\alpha_{2}a_{2}+\alpha_{3}a_{3}+\dots+\alpha_{n_{o}(A)}a_{n_{o}(A)}=0$ has non-trivial solution as well.

That means the scalars $\alpha_{i}$ are not all zero.

1. If one of the vectors in set $A$ can be expressed as the [[Linear Combination of Vectors|Linear Combination of other vectors]], the set $A$ is $LD$.
