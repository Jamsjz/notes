# Inconsistent Data

> Be consistent not inconsistent!

## Theory

**Inconsistent data** refers to data that contradicts itself or does not follow a uniform format across different records or datasets. This inconsistency may arise from errors during data entry, different data formats being used, or discrepancies in how data is stored or reported.

Inconsistent data can lead to problems in data analysis, decision-making, and system performance. It is important to address data inconsistency to maintain the quality and reliability of the dataset.

## Examples

The table below illustrates various examples of inconsistent data, showing how discrepancies can appear in different fields.

| **Field**          | **Inconsistent Data**                                    | **Correct Data**          | **Explanation**                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Date**           | `12/15/2023` (MM/DD/YYYY) vs `15/12/2023` (DD/MM/YYYY)   | `12/15/2023` (MM/DD/YYYY) | The date format is inconsistent. It should be standardized to one format.  |
| **Location**       | `New York` vs `new york` vs `NY`                         | `New York`                | The location name should be consistently capitalized.                      |
| **Age**            | `25`, `30`, `forty`, `50`                                | `25`, `30`, `40`, `50`    | "forty" is a text representation and should be replaced with numeric `40`. |
| **Marital Status** | `Married` vs `Single`                                    | `Married`                 | A person cannot be both married and single at the same time.               |
| **Email**          | `alice@email.com`, `alice@email.com`, `alice@domain.com` | `alice@email.com`         | Duplicate entries need to be removed or unified to one accurate email.     |
| **Address**        | `Not Provided` vs `123 Street Name`                      | `123 Street Name`         | Missing or incomplete values should be handled consistently.               |
| **Phone Number**   | `555-1234`, `555 1234`, `555.1234`                       | `555-1234`                | Standardize the phone number format (e.g., hyphens for separators).        |
