## Theory
Also known as block matrix, partitioned Matrix is a matrix that is interpreted as having been broken into sections called blocks or sub-matrices.

Each sub-matrix's order should be less than of the original matrix.

See [this](https://www.cfm.brown.edu/people/dobrush/cs52/Mathematica/Part2/partition.html) site for more further elaboration.

This type of matrix can be used to find [[Inverse of a Matrix]].
