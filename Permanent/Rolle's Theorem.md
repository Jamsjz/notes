## Theory
If a function $f$ is defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$ such that:
1. $f$ is [[Continuity|continuous]] on $[a,b]$.
2. $f$ is [[Differentiability of a Function|Differentiable]] on $(a,b)$
3. $f(a)=f(b)$
Then, There exists at least one point c in the open interval (a,b) such that the derivative $f'(c)=0$.
