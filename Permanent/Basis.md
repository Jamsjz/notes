## Theory
Given a [[Vector Space]] $V$ defined over a [[Mathematical Field|field]] $\mathbb{F}$, then a non-empty [[Subset]] of $V$, $B$ is said to be basis of V if:
1. The vectors in B are [[Linearly Independent]].
2. The vectors in $B$ [[Span]] the vector space $V$. i.e $\operatorname{span}(B)=V$
