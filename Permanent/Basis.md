## Theory
Given a [[Vector Space]] $V_{n}$ defined over a [[Mathematical Field]] $\mathbb{F}$, If for a [[Subspace of a Vector Space]] of $V_{n}$ say $A$, the span  of the subset of $A$, span$(H)=A$ then H is the basis of A.

### Formal Defination

Let $V$ be a [[Vector Space]] over a field $\mathbb{F}$, a [[Subset]] $B \subset V$ is called a basis for $V$ if:
1. The vectors in B are [[Linearly Independent]].
2. The vectors in $B$ [[Span]] the vector space $V$. i.e $\operatorname{span}(B)=V$
