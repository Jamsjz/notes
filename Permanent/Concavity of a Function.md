## Theory

Concavity of a function $f(x)$ is the curvature of the function at the given interval. In the figure, you can see that when $f''(x)<0$, there is Concave Downwards, and when $f''(x)>0$, there is Concave Upwards.

### Point of Inflection
The point where the concavity of the graph changes is the point of inflection.

We should not always rely on the concept that when $f''(x)=0$, there will be point of inflection.

But where $2^{\text{nd}}$ derivative might not be defined, there might still be a point of inflection.
It is just the matter of intervals and what $f''(x)$ compares with $0$ in that intervals.
