## Theory
Let $V_{n}$ be a [[Vector Space]] over a [[Mathematical Field|field]] $\mathbb{F}$, and let
$S$ be a non-empty [[Subset]] of $V_{n}$ such that $n_{o}(S)=a$.

The span of $S$, denoted as span$(S)$, is the set of all possible [[Linear Combination of Vectors]] in $S$ and is defined as:
$$
span(S) = \{
\bar{x}:\bar{x}=c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\dots+c_{a}v_{a}
\text{ }|v_{i}\in S, c_{i}\in \mathbb{F}
\}
$$
where $c_{i}$ are scalars from the field $\mathbb{F}$, and $n$ is any non-negative integer.
