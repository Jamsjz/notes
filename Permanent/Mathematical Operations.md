# Mathematical Operations
==2024-11-18

## Theory
Mathematical Operations are the [[Function|functions]] that we can perform among the members of the set.

What we operate on is called [[Operand]].
What we operate is called [[Operator]].

The process of operator applying certain function on the operands is called an operation.

### Definition
For a given set A, an operation (\*) is defined as the function taken from $A\times A$ to $A$ and is well-defined such that for every $(a,b) \in A^2$, $a*b\in A$.

i.e
$$*: A\times A\to A$$

> [!important]
> The above definition is specially for binary operations.

There are many [[Types of Mathematical Operations]].

---
## Examples
Addition between two numbers is a mathematical operation.

## Q&A

> [!question] How can we know if [[Mathematical Operations]] are well defined?
> If the outcome of the operation lies in the set from which we take the operands then the operation is well defined.
> i.e $\forall(a,b)\in A\times A$, $a*b\in A$. 
>> [!important] 
>>>
>> If an operation is well defined, we generally talk and discuss
>> about the [[Mathematical Properties]] of the operation.
>> But if it is not well defined, we do not consider the properties
>> but look for a different operation all together.
>>> [!example] 
>>>
>>> You cannot divide [[Matrices]] together. So we look for another operation called [[Inverse of a Matrix]]. And then perform [[Multiplication of Matrices]] on those matrices.
