# Intervals of Function Increase or Decrease

## Theory

A function $f(x)$ increases at a given interval $(a,b)$ if $\forall x_{o}\in(a,b)$, $f'(x_{o})>0$.

That means, at that interval, when $x$ increases, $y$ increases as well because of the positive slope of the curve.

Similarly, if $f'(x_{o})>0$, the function is decreasing at that interval due to the negative slope of the curve.
