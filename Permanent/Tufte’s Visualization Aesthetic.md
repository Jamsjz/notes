## Theory
### Tufte’s Visualization Aesthetic

[[Pasted image 20241224131116.png|Edward Tufte]], a pioneer in data visualization, outlined principles for designing effective and truthful visualizations. These principles focus on reducing visual clutter and maximizing the clarity of data representation. Key aspects include:

1. **Maximize [[Data-Ink Ratio]]**  

$$\text{Data Ink Ratio}=\frac{\text{Data Ink}}{\text{Total Ink Used in Graph}}$$

   - Data-ink refers to the ink used to represent data in a chart.  
   - Minimize non-essential ink (e.g., decorative elements) to focus on the data itself.

2. **Minimize [[Lie Factor on Data Visualizations|Lie Factor]]**  

$$
\text{Lie Factor} = \frac{\text{size of effect in graphic}}{\text{size of effect in data}}
$$

   - Ensure the representation of data is proportional to the values depicted.  
   - Avoid visual distortions that exaggerate or diminish differences.
	- **Lie Factor: Dimentionality**
		- The fixing a two or three-dimensional representation by a single parameter yields a lie, because area or volume increase non-proportionally to length.

**[[Graphical Integrity]]: [[Scale in Graphs|Scale Distortion]]**
- Always start bar graphs at zero.
- Always properly label your axes.
- Use continuous scales: linear or labelled!

- **Aspect Ratio:** The steepness of apparent cliffs is a function of aspect ratio.
- Aim for 45° lines or Golden ratio as most interpret-able.

3. **Minimize Chartjunk**  
Strive for simplicity and elegance in design. Remove unnecessary design elements like:
   - Extra Dimensions
   - Heavy grid-lines
   - Excessive use of colors and patterns 

4. **Use [[Scale in Graphs|Proper Scales]] and Clear Labeling**  
   - Employ scales that are appropriate for the data and context.  
   - Clearly label:
	   - axes
	   - Data Points
	   - Key Trends

Tufte’s principles serve as foundational guidelines for creating [[Data Visualization]] that are both aesthetically pleasing and effective in communicating data-driven insights.
