## Theory
While the terms "antiderivative" and "integration" are often used in calculus, they refer to related but distinct concepts. Below is a summary of their differences.

### Antiderivative

An **antiderivative** of a function $f(x)$ is a function $F(x)$ such that:

$$
F'(x) = f(x)
$$


This means that the derivative of the antiderivative $F(x)$ gives back the original function $f(x)$. Antiderivatives are not unique; they can differ by a constant. Therefore, the general form of an antiderivative can be expressed as:

$$
F(x) + C
$$


where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.

### Integration

**Integration**, particularly indefinite integration, refers to the process of finding the antiderivative of a function. The notation for the indefinite integral of $f(x)$ is:

$$
\int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C
$$


This notation indicates that we are looking for all possible antiderivatives of $f(x)$, which can be expressed as a family of functions differing by a constant.

### Key Differences

1. **Definition**:
   - **Antiderivative**: A specific function whose derivative equals the original function.
   - **Integration**: The process of finding all antiderivatives of a function.

2. **Notation**:
   - Antiderivative: Typically denoted as $F(x)$ where $F'(x) = f(x)$.
   - Integration: Denoted using the integral sign, e.g., $\int f(x) \, dx$.

3. **Uniqueness**:
   - Antiderivatives are unique up to an additive constant.
   - Integration yields a family of functions (the set of all antiderivatives).

### Conclusion

In summary, while both concepts are interconnected in calculus, an antiderivative is a specific function that satisfies a derivative condition, whereas integration is the broader process used to find such functions.
