## Theory
The **indefinite integral** is a fundamental concept in calculus that represents a family of functions whose derivative is a given function. Formally, if `f(x)` is a function, the indefinite integral of `f` with respect to `x` is denoted as:

$$
\int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C
$$


where `F(x)` is any antiderivative of `f(x)`, and `C` is an arbitrary constant. This notation signifies that the indefinite integral encompasses all possible antiderivatives of the function `f(x)`.

## Key Components

- **Integrand**: The function `f(x)` that is being integrated.
- **Variable of Integration**: The variable `x`, which indicates the variable with respect to which the integration is performed.
- **Integral Sign**: The symbol `âˆ«`, which denotes the operation of integration.

## Definition

The set of all antiderivatives of a function `f(x)` can be defined as follows:

$$
\text{Indefinite Integral of } f = \{ F : I \to \mathbb{R} \mid F'(x) = f(x) \text{ for all } x \in I \}
$$


This means that if a function `F` satisfies the condition that its derivative equals `f(x)`, then it belongs to the class of functions represented by the indefinite integral of `f(x)`.

## Properties

1. **Linearity**: The indefinite integral is linear, meaning that for any constants `a` and `b`:
   $$
   \int (af(x) + bg(x)) \, dx = a\int f(x) \, dx + b\int g(x) \, dx
   $$
   where `g(x)` is another function.

2. **Constant Addition**: If `F(x)` is an antiderivative of `f(x)`, then `F(x) + C`, where `C` is any constant, is also an antiderivative of `f(x)`.
