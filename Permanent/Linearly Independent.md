## Theory
Given a [[Set]] of vectors $A$ defined over a [[Mathematical Field|Field]] $\mathbb{F}$, $A$ is said to be Linearly Independent if $\exists$ scalars $\text{ }\text{ }\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3},\dots,\alpha_{n_{o}(A)}\in \mathbb{F}$ such that the equation:
$\alpha_{1}a_{1}+\alpha_{2}a_{2}+\alpha_{3}a_{3}+\dots+\alpha_{n_{o}(A)}a_{n_{o}(A)}=0$ has only trivial solution.

That means all the scalars are zero.
