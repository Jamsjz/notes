# One Sided Limit
==2024-11-17

## Theory
$\lim_{ x \to c }f(x)$ if exists, means $f(x)$ can be approached from both sides left and right at an interior point c.

$\lim_{ x \to c^- }f(x)$ is the limit of the function when c is approached from left.

Similarly,
$\lim_{ x \to c^+ }f(x)$ is the limit of the function when c is approached from right.

That means,
$\lceil c^+ \rceil = c+1$ and $\lfloor c^+\rfloor=c-1$ 

$\lim_{ x \to c^+ }f(x)$ is right hand limit
$\lim_{ x \to c^- }f(x)$ is left hand limit
