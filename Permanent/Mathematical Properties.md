## Theory
Mathematical Properties evolve from [[Mathematical Operations]].
The operations and [[Set]] gives the required conditions when certain [[Mathematical Statements]] become true.

## Q&A

> [!question] Why are properties important?
> Properties are important to derive the application of those logics in the real world.
>> [!example] 
>> To calculate the distance I have travelled from a reference point,
>>  you take the modulus of my displacement because distance is
>>  practically a [[Scalar]] so it's positive or zero and so is $|x|$
>>   since, $|x|\geq 0$.
>> 
>> Here, we wouldn't get the idea to take the $|x|$ if we didn't know the above property.
