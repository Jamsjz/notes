## Theory
A [[Set]] $A$ of n-tuples is said to be a subspace of $V_{n}$ if it follows the following [[Mathematical Axioms]]:

1. $A\subset V_{n}$
for $u,v\in A$,
2. addition is defined on $A$.(closure)
	$u+v\in A$
1. scalar multiplication is defined on $A$.(closure)
	for a scalar c, $cu\in A$.
1. $\bar{0}$ exists in A. 
	$\bar{0}\in A$
