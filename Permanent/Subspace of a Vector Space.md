## Theory
A non-empty [[Subset|subset]] $A$ of [[Vector Space]] $V$ is said to be a subspace of $V$ if the following axioms hold $\forall u,v\in A$:
1. addition is defined on $A$.(Additive Closure)
	$u+v\in A$
2. scalar multiplication is defined on $A$.(Multiplicative Closure)
	for a scalar c, $cu\in A$.
3. $\bar{0}$ exists in A. 
	$\bar{0}\in A$

# PTR

1. Third point is extra since if second is fulfilled then third will be for $c = 0$ .
