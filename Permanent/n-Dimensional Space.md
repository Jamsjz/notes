# n-Dimensional Space

## Theory
n-Dimensional Space or n-space is a big challenge for [[Science]].
We see the world around us in three dimensions but we encounter many different factors in the world. Every factor is a [[Dimension]] to this reality.

### Set for n-space

n-space is the set of all possible ordered [[n-Tuples]] taken from $\mathbb{R}^n$ and is written as:

$\mathbb{R}^n=\begin{cases} \bar{x}:\bar{x}=(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3},\dots,x_{n})\text{ where } x_{i} \in \mathbb{R},1\leq i \leq n\end{cases}$}

Here, we have defined the [[Set]] for the [[Vector Space]] [[Structures or Systems]].

>There aren't any tuples inside of tuple because they are ordered and
>we have used the associative property of [[Cartesian Product of a Set]].
