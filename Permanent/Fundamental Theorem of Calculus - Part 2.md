## Theory
The **Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** provides a method for evaluating definite integrals. It states that if  $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$, and $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$, then:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

This theorem indicates that to compute the definite integral of a function over an interval, one can evaluate its antiderivative at the upper and lower bounds and subtract these values.

### Implications

- This theorem simplifies the computation of definite integrals significantly.
- It shows that integration can be performed without relying on Riemann sums or geometric interpretations.

In summary, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus elegantly links the processes of differentiation and integration, providing essential tools for analysis in calculus.
