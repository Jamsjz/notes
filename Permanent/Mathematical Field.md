## Theory
A field in mathematics is a [[Set]] $\mathbb{F}$ equipped with two binary operations, typically referred to as addition $+$ and multiplication $*$, satisfying specific properties.

The formal definition can be outlined as follows:
1. A field consists of a set $\mathbb{F}$ containing at least two elements.
2. Binary Operations: The operations + and ⋅ must be defined for all elements in $\mathbb{F}$.
3. Axioms: The following axioms must hold for all elements $a,b,c∈F$:
	1. Closure: For all $a,b\in \mathbb{F}$, both a+b and a.b are in $\mathbb{F}$
	2. Associativity(Both multiplication and addition)
	3. Commutativity(Both multiplication and addition)
	4. Existence of identity.
	5. Existence of inverse.
	6. Distributive Property

### Notation
A field $\mathbb{F}$ is simply denoted as so,
$\mathbb{F}(F,+,.)$

## Examples
A = {1,0} is a field.
$\mathbb{R}$ is a field.

# PTR

1. Field is essentially combination of two [[Mathematical Group]]s.
2. Field is the triplet of set, addition operation and multiplication.
