| **Definition**           | Hands-on data exploration and evaluation.                                          | A broader term encompassing the methodology and science behind the analysis, with data analysis as a subset.    |
| **Scope**                | Focused on examining datasets to uncover patterns, trends, or insights.            | Involves the entire lifecycle of working with data, including collection, processing, analysis, and reporting.  |
| **Objective**            | To interpret raw data and answer specific questions or hypotheses.                 | To use systematic and scientific approaches to support decision-making and strategic planning.                  |
| **Methods Used**         | Primarily includes statistical methods, visualization, and descriptive techniques. | Incorporates advanced techniques such as machine learning, predictive modeling, and prescriptive analytics.     |
| **Tools and Techniques** | Tools like Excel, Tableau, or Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.      | Broader set of tools, including databases (SQL), programming (R, Python), and advanced frameworks (TensorFlow). |
| **Output**               | Generates insights, trends, and summaries from data.                               | Provides actionable insights, predictions, and recommendations for business or research.                        |
