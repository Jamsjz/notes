## Theory
A transformation is a function $T:X→Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are sets(usually vector spaces), that maps each element $x∈X$ (the **preimage**) to a unique element $T(x)∈Y$ (the **image**). 

Transformations can be applied to geometric shapes, functions, or abstract algebraic structures.

There are two types of transformation:
1. [[Non-Linear Transformation]]
2. [[Linearity of a Transformation|Linear Transformation]]
