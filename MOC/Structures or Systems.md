## Theory
A Structure in [[Mathematics]] is the triplet of  [[Set]], [[Mathematical Operations]], and [[Mathematical Properties]].

The set consists of all possible variations of observations in the system or structure.

For example [[Number Theory]] is a structure as it consists of a [[Set]] of [[Numbers in Different Base]], the [[Mathematical Operations]] we can do among the numbers and the [[Mathematical Properties]] that evolve from those operations.

Some Structures are:
- [[n-Dimensional Space]] or [[Vector Space]]
- [[Field]]
- [[Group]]
- [[Matrices]]
