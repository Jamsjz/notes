## [[Categories of Data Analysis Techniques]]  
- **[[Descriptive Analysis]]:** What happened?  
- **[[Diagnostic Analytics]]:** Why did it happen?  
- **[[Predictive Analysis]]:** What is likely to happen?  
- **[[Prescriptive Analysis]]:** What should we do about it?

### [[Descriptive Analysis]]  
- Categorizes and summarizes raw data to uncover patterns.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Categorizing customers by purchasing patterns.  
  - Analyzing census data.  
- **Key Measures:**  
  - [[Mean]]  
  - [[Median]]  
  - [[Mode]]  

---

### [[Diagnostic Analytics]]  
- Examines causes and effects to determine why something happened.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Social media campaign analysis.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - [[Correlation]]  
- **Purpose:**  
  - Refines strategies based on past performance.  

---

### [[Predictive Analysis]]  
- Predicts future outcomes based on past data.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Predicting consumer behavior during tax season.  
- **Tools:**  
  - [[SAS Predictive Analytics]]  
  - [[IBM Predictive Analytics]]  
  - [[RapidMiner]]  
- **Key Considerations:**  
  - Predictions are based on probabilities, not guarantees.  

---

### [[Prescriptive Analysis]]  
- Identifies the best course of action by analyzing parameters.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Healthcare management: Prioritizing treatments.  
  - Risk management: Mitigating potential risks.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - [[Optimization]]  
  - [[Simulation]]  
  - [[Game Theory]]  
  - [[Decision-Analysis Methods]]
