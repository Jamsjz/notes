## Definition of Vector Space [[Structures or Systems]]

Vector space is a non-empty set $V$, of objects called vectors, which are defined by two operations, called addition and multiplication by scalars, which satisfy the 10 axioms listed below. The axioms must hold for all vectors $u, v, w \in V$ , and scalars $c, d \in \mathbb{R}$.

1. $u + v \in V$
2. $u + v = v + u$
3. $(u + v) + w = u + (v + w)$
4. $\text{ }\exists \text{ } \bar{0} \in V \text{ s.t. } u + \bar{0} = u$
5. $\exists \text{ } (-u) \in V \text{ s.t. }u + (-u) = 0$
6. $cu \in V$
7. $c(u + v) = cu + cv$
8. $(c + d)u = cu + du$
9. $c(du) = (cd)u$
10. $1u = u$

By extension of the above axioms:
1. $0u=0$
2. $c \bar{0}=0$
3. $-u=(-1)u$
