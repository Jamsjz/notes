# Derivative of a Function

## Theory
$\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$ is called the difference quotient or the slope of a secant.
when x approaches a, the secant becomes a tangent. That slope is the slope of the tangent at point $x=a$.

So, The derivative of a [[Function]] $f(x)$ at a point $x=a$ is defined as:
$$
f'(x)=\lim_{ x \to a } \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}
$$
An alternative definition called First Principle is such that:
$$
f'(x)=\lim_{ h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$
From the first definitions it is clear that derivative gives the slope of [[Tangent of a Curve]] at point $(x,f(x))$ as it is in the form of:
$$
\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
$$

The process of calculating derivatives is known as **differentiation** and can be performed only if [[Differentiability of a Function]] holds.

In essence, the derivative provides a measure of how sensitive the output of the function is to changes in its input.

It is crucial for understanding various properties of functions, such as:
1. Identifying [[Extremas of a Function]]
2. Determining [[Intervals of Function Increase or Decrease]]
3. Analyzing [[Concavity of a Function]][1](https://study.com/academy/lesson/derivative-of-a-function-definition-example.html)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_(mathematics)).
4. Analyzing [[Monotonicity of a Function]]


### Critical Points of a function
It is the point of a function at which the slope of tangent is 0 or undefined.
i.e $f'(a)=0$ or undefined then $x=a$ is a critical point.
