Integration of a [[Functions]] $f(x)$ is of two types.
1. [[Definite Integrals]]
	1. [[Proper Integrals]]
	2. [[Improper Integrals]]
		1. [[Improper Integrals: Type 1]]
		2. [[Improper Integrals: Type 2]]
2. [[Indefinite Integrals]]
The relation between integration and derivative is given in
[[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]. Using it we can find the
[[Average Value of a Function]].

See [[Graphical Interpretation of integration]].
We can not only find the Area under the curve with integration but also the length
of the curve of the function.
