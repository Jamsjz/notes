> [!tip] Integration:
> - Integration is the process of finding the total accumulation of a quantity.
> - It is the reverse process of differentiation (antiderivative).

--

> [!example] Example 1: Relation to Derivative
 > Consider a function $f(x)=\sin(x)$
  > $$\implies F(x)=\int \sin(x)dx = F(x)=-\cos(x)$$
  > $$\implies\frac{dF(x)}{dx}=d\frac{-\cos(x)}{dx}=\sin(x)=f(x)$$

## Integration as Limit of Sums

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}hf(x_{i})=
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx
$$

## Solid of Revolution (SoR)
Solids of revolution are 3D shapes formed by rotating a 2D region around an axis.

## Finding Volume of SoR
There are many methods of finding the volume,
We will discuss two of them: 
1) Disk Method
2) Washer Method

---
## Disk Method
For solids without holes
![[Pasted image 20250131174209.png]]

--
> [!example] Example 3.1
> Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y=\sqrt{ x }$ and the lines $y=1$, $x=4$ about the line $y=1$.
> ![[Pasted image 20250211175009.png]]

--
> [!example] Example 3.2
> Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region between the parabola $x = y^{2} + 1$ and the line $x = 3$ about the line $x = 3$.

> [!example] Example 4.1
> Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by the graphs about the x-axis for $y=x^2$ and $y=\sqrt{ x }$
