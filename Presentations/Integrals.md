## Introduction to Integration

+ process of finding the whole ...
+ by summing up the parts to find the whole.

---
## Example 1: Relation to Derivative

For example:
Consider a function,

$$f(x)=sin(x)$$

Then,

$$
F(x)=\int \sin(x)dx = F(x)=-\cos(x)
$$

Then,

$$
\frac{dF(x)}{dx}=d\frac{-\cos(x)}{dx}=\sin(x)=f(x)
$$

## Integration as Area: Geometrical Interpretation

+ Our goal is to find the exact area under the curve
+ bounded by the variable axis.
+ The area below -> negative area.
+ The area above -> positive area

## Integration as Limit of Sums
![[GenScene_ManimCE_v0.18.1.gif]]
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}hf(x_{i})=
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx
$$

## Solid of Revolution (SoR)
Solids of revolution are 3D shapes formed by rotating a 2D region around an axis.

## Finding Volume of SoR
There are many methods of finding the volume,
We will discuss two of them: 
1. Disk Method
2. Washer Method

## Disk Method
> For solids without holes
