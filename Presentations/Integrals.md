## Relation to Derivatives
Consider a function,

$$y=f(x)$$

It's derivative is written as:

$$\frac{df(x)}{dx}$$

Integration of the function is written as:

$$F(x)=\int f(x)dx$$

such that,

$$\frac{dF(x)}{dx}=f(x)$$

---

For example:
Consider a function,

$$f(x)=sin(x)$$

Then,

$$
F(x)=\int \sin(x)dx = F(x)=-\cos(x)
$$

Then,

$$
\frac{dF(x)}{dx}=d\frac{-\cos(x)}{dx}=\sin(x)=f(x)
$$

# Why Integrate ?
![[GenScene_ManimCE_v0.18.1.gif]]
+ Our goal is to find the exact area under the curve
+ bounded by the variable axis.
+ The area below -> negative area.
+ The area above -> positive area

## Integration as Limit of Sums

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}hf(x_{i})=
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx
$$

## Solid of Revolution (SoR)
Solids of revolution are 3D shapes formed by rotating a 2D region around an axis.
